# ArXiv API

For constructing queries with the ArXiv API, it's essential to understand the different fields you can search on and how to use them effectively. Below is a table summarizing the possible fields for queries, their explanations, and examples of usage. This information is pivotal for crafting precise search queries to retrieve relevant academic papers from ArXiv.

| **Field** | **Explanation** | **Example Usage** |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| `ti`      | Searches within the title of the paper. | `ti:"quantum entanglement"` |
| `au`      | Searches for papers by a specific author. | `au:"Albert Einstein"` |
| `abs`     | Searches within the abstract of the paper. | `abs:"black hole information paradox"` |
| `co`      | Searches within the comments field. | `co:"This article is a review"` |
| `jr`      | Searches within the journal reference field. | `jr:"Phys. Rev. Lett."` |
| `cat`     | Searches within a specific arXiv category. | `cat:hep-th` |
| `rn`      | Searches by report number. | `rn:"arXiv:1703.00001"` |
| `id`      | Searches by the arXiv ID. | `id:1703.00001` |
| `all`     | Searches across all fields. | `all:"dark matter"` |

### Boolean Operators in Queries

- **AND**: Combines two queries, returning results that satisfy both.
- **OR**: Combines two queries, returning results that satisfy at least one.
- **ANDNOT**: Combines two queries, returning results that satisfy the first but not the second.

### Special Query Features

- **Phrase Searching**: Enclose phrases in double quotes to search for the exact phrase. 
  - Example: `ti:"dark energy"`
- **Grouping**: Use parentheses to group parts of your query.
  - Example: `(au:"Albert Einstein" AND ti:"General Relativity") OR abs:"spacetime curvature"`
- **Wildcards**: Use asterisks (*) as wildcards to match any characters.
  - Example: `ti:"quantum *"`

### Note on Article Versions

When searching by arXiv ID (`id` field), specifying the article version is optional. If not specified, the latest version is returned. To request a specific version, append `v[number]` to the ID.

- Example: `id:1703.00001v1`

### Combining Fields

You can combine different fields using Boolean operators to form complex queries that target very specific papers.

- Example: `au:"Stephen Hawking" AND abs:"black holes"`

### Date Ranges and Other Specific Queries

While the ArXiv API documentation does not explicitly list a way to search by submission date through the query interface, some services may offer functionality to filter search results by date. For detailed, complex queries involving dates or other specific metadata not directly searchable through the standard query interface, consider using the API's advanced search capabilities or the website's interface for manual searches.
